# christmas_light
A christmas light sequence for Raspberry Pi and WS2801 lamps.

Background:
I got a Raspbarry Pi and two strips of WS2801 lamps (100 in total).
What I want to do is some nice christmas lightning when it hangs outside my house.  It's not for a christmas tree.

Some code is borrowed/stolen from an arduino projects I found called MashedPixels
